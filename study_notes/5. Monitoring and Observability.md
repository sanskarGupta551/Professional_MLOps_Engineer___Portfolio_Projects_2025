# Monitoring and Observability

Monitoring and Observability ensures ML systems remain reliable, performant, and aligned with business objectives through comprehensive tracking of model performance, data quality, system health, and business impact. Unlike traditional software monitoring, ML observability must account for model degradation, data drift, and probabilistic behavior inherent in machine learning systems.

## What is Monitoring and Observability in MLOps?

**Monitoring and Observability** in MLOps extends traditional software monitoring to address the unique challenges of machine learning systems. While traditional monitoring focuses on system health and performance, ML monitoring must also track model performance, data quality, prediction accuracy, and business impact. Observability provides the deeper insights needed to understand *why* ML systems behave as they do, not just *what* is happening.
